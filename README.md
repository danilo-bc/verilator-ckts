# Digital Circuits Simulation with Verilator

This repository aims to simulate stochastic circuits in Verilator. To achieve that, other, conventional circuits are used as basis.

Roadmap:
* Simulate simple sequential circuits
* Simulate deterministic Sobel filter
* Simulate stochastic Sobel filter

Verilator Material:
* [Official website](https://www.veripool.org/)
